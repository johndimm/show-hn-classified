Hacker News has thousands of apps that have been submitted for discussion.  New apps, like mine, quickly drop to the bottom of the lists where few users look.  I quickly get bored looking at one random app after another.  There are no categories and no tags.

Hacker News is against tags and categories for its news articles because that would create silos.  They want everyone to see the same information.  

That is a reasonable concern for news articles, but applied to the huge list of uploaded apps it doesn't really make sense.  I am more interested in visualizations of knowledge than software engineering tools so silos seem natural to me for apps.

Create an app that reads hacker news submitted apps and classifies them.  The urls are

  https://news.ycombinator.com/show

and
 
  https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew

There is a More button at the bottom.  Use it to pull the complete list.  

The categories should be based on the github or app page that is linked on the Show HN posts, not just the title.

Create cateogries that have a resonable number of apps.  No need for a category that has only one app, or a category with thousands.

Also, when possible find an image to associate with the app and a description.  The result should be a series of pages that show a category name followed by a list of apps showing the image, title, and description along with the original link.  

Save the downloaded data in a ./data directory for this app.  I will deploy the app using vercel.  In a later version we may load it all into a database and generate the pages on the fly.
